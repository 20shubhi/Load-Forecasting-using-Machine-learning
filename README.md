# Load-Forecasting-using-Machine-learning
In the project focused on electrical load forecasting, extensive analysis of load patterns was conducted to 
understand the underlying trends and variations. Subsequently, Machine Learning (ML) models were 
selected based on their suitability for predicting future load demands with high accuracy. The chosen
models for this task were the Linear Regression Modeland the Decision Tree Model.
